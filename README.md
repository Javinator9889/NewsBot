## Installing

1. First, you have to create a table in **MySQL** like this:
+--------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field        | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| chat_id      | int(15)       | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| lang         | char(2)       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| preferences  | varchar(1000) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| diff_time    | varchar(50)   | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| is_time      | varchar(5)    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| programation | varchar(150)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| is_prog      | varchar(5)    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| is_pref      | varchar(5)    | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| msg_id       | int(20)       | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| max_results  | int(3)        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| next_prog    | varchar(150)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| usr_name     | varchar(150)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+--------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

Use:
`CREATE TABLE NewsBot (

--> usr_name VARCHAR(150),

--> chat_id INT(15) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,

--> lang CHAR(2),

--> diff_time VARCHAR(50),

--> preferences VARCHAR(10000),

--> programation VARCHAR(150),

--> next_prog VARCHAR(150),

--> msg_id INT(20),

--> max_results INT(3),

--> is_time VARCHAR(5),

--> is_prog VARCHAR(5),

--> is_pref VARCHAR(5)

);`

2. Then, ask [BotFather](http://t.me/BotFather) for a TOKEN unique for your bot.
3. Save that token into a file called *TOKEN.txt*.
4. Go to [this Google page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) and ask for your API-KEY. Save it in *API-KEY_geo.txt* (don't forget to activate your API).
5. Go to [this another Google page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/timezone/start) and ask for your API-KEY. Save it in *API-KEY.txt* (don't forget to activate your API).
